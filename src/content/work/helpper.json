As Lead Product Designer, I was responsible for the UX/UI of the website, mobile app, and web dashboard. Beyond visual design, I led user testing and collaborated closely with developers to create an accessible and seamless experience. The result was a thoughtfully designed product that empowered both helpers and those in need.",
