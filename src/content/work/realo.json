  "description": "Realo is a real estate listing platform designed to make property searches faster, easier, and more transparent. As the company’s first designer, I built the platform’s UX from the ground up, researching how people browse and compare properties online. The project required refining data-heavy interfaces, designing clear and informative charts, maps, and widgets, and ensuring a smooth, responsive experience. I also optimized performance by reducing load times and streamlining the codebase. After months of iteration and testing, Realo launched to widespread acclaim, praised for its speed and intuitive design.",
