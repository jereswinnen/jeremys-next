  "description": "Immo Brown, a high-end real estate agency in Belgium, needed a modern website to maintain its competitive edge. Over the course of two weeks, I designed a mobile-first, luxury aesthetic website that reflected their exclusivity. By using dark colors and minimalist iconography, I highlighted their premium property portfolio while ensuring a seamless user experience. I worked closely with the client, iterating on feedback to refine the design. Once developed, the launch received positive feedback from both new and existing clients, successfully elevating their digital presence.",
