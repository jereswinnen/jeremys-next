  "description": "Shelf is an iPad app that allows users to temporarily store files—images, documents, links, and more—for quick and easy access. At Lickability, I worked on designing a UI that balanced aesthetics with functionality, exploring bold color palettes, file previews, and scalable iconography. Through multiple design phases, I refined the visual hierarchy and iconography to create a polished, intuitive experience. Despite the app not launching due to resource constraints, the project was a success. In just six weeks, I designed a full-fledged UI that supported Split Screen, Slide Over, and multiple orientations, ensuring a seamless experience for users who like to do more with their iPad.",
